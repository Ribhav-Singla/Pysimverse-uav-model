## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'`
**Solution**:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

#### Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mujoco'`
**Solution**:
```bash
pip install mujoco
```

#### Issue: UAV doesn't stay at goal
**Solution**: The goal stabilization system should handle this automatically. Check:
- `goal_reached` flag is being set
- Stabilization velocity is being applied
- Goal distance threshold is appropriate (0.5m detection, 0.1m lock)

#### Issue: Training not converging
**Solution**: Try adjusting:
- Increase `episodes_per_level` for more practice per difficulty
- Reduce `action_std` for less exploration
- Increase `update_timestep` for more stable updates
- Check reward structure is appropriate

#### Issue: Collisions during navigation
**Solution**:
- Verify LIDAR sensor is working (`test_lidar.py`)
- Check obstacle clearances are reasonable
- Increase velocity damping in early training
- Verify collision detection threshold

#### Issue: MuJoCo viewer not opening
**Solution**:
```bash
# Linux: Install OpenGL libraries
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa

# Windows: Update graphics drivers
# Ensure GPU drivers are up to date
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```python
# In uav_env.py or uav_render.py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
