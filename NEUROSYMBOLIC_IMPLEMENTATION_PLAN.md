# Neurosymbolic UAV Navigation Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the integration of Ripple Down Rules (RDR) with Reinforcement Learning for enhanced UAV navigation performance.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Neurosymbolic System (`neurosymbolic_rdr.py`)
- **RDR Knowledge Base**: Stores navigation rules with conditions and actions
- **Rule Engine**: Evaluates current state against rules and provides advice
- **Integration Layer**: Combines RL actions with symbolic advice

### 2. Enhanced PPO Agent (`neurosymbolic_ppo_agent.py`)
- **Symbolic Feature Encoding**: Augments observation space with rule activations
- **Action Integration**: Blends RL and symbolic actions using weighted combination
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors rule effectiveness and usage

### 3. Human Interface (`human_rule_interface.py`)
- **GUI Interface**: Visual rule creation and monitoring
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line rule management
- **Template Library**: Pre-defined rule patterns

### 4. Training Integration (`neurosymbolic_training.py`)
- **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive difficulty with symbolic guidance
- **Real-time Rule Addition**: Human experts can add rules during training
- **Performance Analytics**: Tracks both RL and symbolic performance
